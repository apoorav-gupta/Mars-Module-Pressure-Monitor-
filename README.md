Mars-Module-Pressure-Monitor-
=============================
This was a project created in a team of 3 to monitor various pressures for a hypothetical manned mission to Mars. Specifically, this simulation monitors the levels of carbon dioxide, oxygen and nitrogen. 

The user can increase or decrease the levels. In doing so, various systems are activated, which increase and decrease pressure in order to reach a safe level. 

Additionally, the user can also enable Low Power Mode, which automatically changes the allowed values into those which require low power consumption.
